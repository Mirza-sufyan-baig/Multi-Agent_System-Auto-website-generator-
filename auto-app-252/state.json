  "plan_content": "### Visual Identity Update\nTo implement the new background color across the site, we will be updating our visual identity to incorporate a light coffee brown tone. This change aims to enhance the overall aesthetic and user experience.\n\n* **Color Palette:**\n\t+ Primary Background Color: #D4B798 (light coffee brown)\n\t+ Secondary Background Color (optional): #F5F5F5 (light gray for contrast)\n* **Fonts:** No changes are planned for the font family or sizes at this time.\n* **Spacing:** No adjustments are needed for spacing and margins with this update.\n\n### Rationale\nThe introduction of #D4B798 as the primary background color is intended to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. This color choice is also expected to improve readability by providing sufficient contrast with the existing text and element colors.\n\n### Implementation\nTo ensure a seamless transition, the following steps will be taken:\n- Update the CSS to reflect the new background color.\n- Verify that the change does not negatively impact any existing design elements or functionality.\n\n---TASKS---\n- [ ] Create a new variable in style.css for the primary background color (`--primary-bg: #D4B798;`)\n- [ ] Update the `body` selector in style.css to use the new primary background color variable (`background-color: var(--primary-bg);`)\n- [ ] Review and adjust any elements in style.css that may require contrast adjustments due to the background color change\n---END_TASKS---",
