### Visual Identity Update
To implement the new background color across the site, we will be updating our visual identity to incorporate a light coffee brown tone. This change aims to enhance the overall aesthetic and user experience.

* **Color Palette:**
	+ Primary Background Color: #D4B798 (light coffee brown)
	+ Secondary Background Color (optional): #F5F5F5 (light gray for contrast)
* **Fonts:** No changes are planned for the font family or sizes at this time.
* **Spacing:** No adjustments are needed for spacing and margins with this update.

### Rationale
The introduction of #D4B798 as the primary background color is intended to create a warm and inviting atmosphere. This color choice is also expected to improve readability by providing sufficient contrast with the existing text and element colors.

### Implementation
To ensure a seamless transition, the following steps will be taken:
- Update the CSS to reflect the new background color.
- Verify that the change does not negatively impact any existing design elements or functionality.

---TASKS---
- [ ] Create a new variable in style.css for the primary background color (`--primary-bg: #D4B798;`)
- [ ] Update the `body` selector in style.css to use the new primary background color variable (`background-color: var(--primary-bg);`)
- [ ] Review and adjust any elements in style.css that may require contrast adjustments due to the background color change
